# BigData-Introduction
1. If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5 but not multiples both of 3 and 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 18. The sum of these multiples is 63. Write a function, sum_multiples_3_5, that returns the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 less than N.<br>
2. Write a function, patternCount with two arguments. The first arguments is a string, lets call it text, and the second argument is also a string, call it pattern. The function patternCount returns the number of times the pattern occurs in the text. For example<br>
pattern_count(“abababa”, “aba”) == 3<br>
pattern_count(“aaaaa”, “aa”) == 4<br>
pattern_count(“Abcde”, “abc”) == 0<br>
3. Write a function product(s : String) that returns the product of the Unicode codes of all letters in string s without using a loop.<br>
4. Write a function noDuplicates(ints : Array[Int]) that returns an array all values from the array ints with duplicates removed.<br>
5. Create an array that contains the value 0.00001f repeated 1000000 times. Sum up all the elements of the array. What is the result? How big is the error?<br>
6. Using Scala compute the sums 0.0001f + 8000.0f and 0.000000001 + 90000000. What is the result? How big is the error?<br>
7. Write a function randomInts(n:Int, range:Int) that returns an array of n integers all between 0 and range.<br>
8. Create three files with random integers in the range 0 to Int.MaxValue/2. The first file contains 1,000 integers, the second 100,000 integers, the third 10,000,000 integers. Write scala code to find the average and median value for each file. What are the average and median value for each file? How long does it take compute those values for each file?<br>
9. Write a function minmax(values: Array[Int]) that returns a pair containing the smallest and the largest values in the array.<br>
10. Make a class Car with read-only properties for manufacturer, model name, and model year, and a read-write property for the license plate. Supply four constructors. All require the manufacturer and model name. Optionally, model year and license plate can also be speci-
fied in the constructor. If not, the model year is set to -1 and the license plate to the empty string. Which constructor are you choosing as the primary constructor? Why?<br>
